Just For fun ("_")
# My Poem 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way<br>
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way<br>
Oh what fun it is to sing a merry Christmas song<br>
<br>
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh<br>
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way<br>
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright<br>
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight<br>
<br>
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way<br>
Oh what fun it is...
